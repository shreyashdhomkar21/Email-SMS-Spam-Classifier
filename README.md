# Email-SMS-Spam-Classifier



This project is a spam classifier built using Flask for web deployment. It uses a trained machine learning model to determine if an email or SMS message is spam or not. The model is based on a Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, and text data is transformed into feature vectors using TF-IDF. Users can input a message into a web form, and the application will predict and display whether the message is spam or not. This tool helps in filtering unwanted messages effectively.
